# ### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python
# 
# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[8]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
(3*4)+5


# In[10]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
200 / 60
